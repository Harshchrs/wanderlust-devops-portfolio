# üåç Wanderlust: A MERN Stack DevOps Portfolio

A modern travel blog application originally created by **[Krishna Acharyaa](https://github.com/krishnaacharyaa/wanderlust)** and re-engineered by me to demonstrate advanced **DevOps proficiency**, focusing on containerization, orchestration, and cloud-native deployment principles.

---

## üöÄ My Goal: Structured DevOps Progression

This repository showcases a structured evolution from a basic MERN app to a **fully automated, cloud-ready deployment pipeline**.  
Each Git branch represents a key stage in this DevOps transformation:

| Branch | Status | Focus | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `main` | ‚úÖ Base Code | **Containerized Setup** | Base MERN codebase configured with **Docker Compose** for instant local deployment. |
| `dockerized` | ‚úÖ Complete | **Containerization** | Fully optimized Docker setup using multi-stage builds and minimal images. |
| `kubernetes` | üèóÔ∏è Upcoming | **Orchestration** | Will demonstrate scalable deployment using **Kubernetes YAMLs / Helm charts**. |
| `terraform` | üèóÔ∏è Upcoming | **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** | Will demonstrate automated cloud provisioning via **Terraform**. |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup (Docker Compose)

This project requires **only Docker** and **Docker Compose (v2)** ‚Äî no need to install Node, MongoDB, or Redis locally.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harshchrs/wanderlust-devops-portfolio.git
cd wanderlust-devops-portfolio
2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Environment Variables
Copy the provided sample environment files:

bash
Copy code
cp backend/.env.sample backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.sample frontend/.env.local
Edit these files if needed to match your local setup (Mongo/Redis configs, ports, etc.).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Launch Services and Initialize Data
A. Launch the Stack
Build and start all services (Backend, Frontend, MongoDB, Redis):

bash
Copy code
docker compose up -d --build
B. Initialize Sample Data
Once containers are running, import the sample data into MongoDB:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it mongo mongoimport --db wanderlust --collection posts --file /data/sample_posts.json --jsonArray
4Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Application
Service	URL	Description
Frontend (React)	http://localhost:5173	User interface for the blog
Backend (Express API)	http://localhost:5000	Runs internally within Docker network

‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
Component	Stack / Tool	My Focus
Original Codebase	MERN Stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node)	Leveraged for DevOps experimentation
Containerization	Docker & Docker Compose	Multi-service orchestration, optimized builds
Database	MongoDB	Persistent containerized data storage
Caching	Redis	Integrated caching within container setup

üß≠ Future Roadmap
 Kubernetes deployment with Helm

 Terraform-based AWS provisioning

 CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions

 Monitoring setup using Prometheus + Grafana

‚≠êÔ∏è Show Your Support
Huge thanks to Krishna Acharyaa for the original MERN project foundation.

If you find my DevOps structure and implementation approach valuable ‚Äî
please consider starring the repository! Your support helps me continue building out the Kubernetes and Terraform stages.

Would you like me to make it *slightly more portfolio-marketing* (like a personal project pitch for recruiters) ‚Äî or keep it *strictly technical-documentation style* for engineers reading the repo?






You said:
can you write it in one go so i can just copy paste


ChatGPT said:
Sure ‚Äî here‚Äôs the final polished README you can copy-paste directly into GitHub.
Perfectly formatted, consistent spacing, links preserved, and professional tone.
